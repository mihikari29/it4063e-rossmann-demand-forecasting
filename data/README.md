# Local Data Layout

The official Rossmann Store Sales competition files belong in:

```text
data/raw/rossmann/
|-- train.csv
|-- test.csv
|-- store.csv
`-- sample_submission.csv
```

All files under `data/raw/` are local, ignored, immutable source artifacts. Do not edit them, commit
them, or use this directory for transformed output. The acquisition command creates the complete
directory atomically and refuses to overwrite an existing directory. The validation command reads
the files and verifies that their SHA-256 checksums remain unchanged.

Follow [the acquisition guide](../docs/DATA_ACQUISITION.md). Phase 1 has not created interim or
processed data directories because transformations begin in Phase 2.
