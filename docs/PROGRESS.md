# Project Progress

## Current implementation and Git state — 2026-10-05

| Scope | State | Integration |
|---|---|---|
| Phases 0–4 | COMPLETE | On `main`; Phase 3 PR #3/#4, Phase 4 PR #5/#6 |
| Phase 5 — additive Holt-Winters | IMPLEMENTED / UNDER REVIEW | On unmerged `feat/holt-winters`; development results below |
| Repository architecture/governance review | COMPLETE as a review task; local/unpublished changes | `docs/architecture-governance-review`, stacked on Phase 5 HEAD `3d4fbfd` |
| Phase 6 and later | PLANNED; implementation not started | Phase 5 review/integration/closeout is the next gate |

Fetched Git and public GitHub PR/branch metadata agree: `origin/main` is
`01cdedbfa2447bd68c3b8a4d2b75bbb70dd16465`; `origin/feat/holt-winters` is
`3d4fbfd39e0931f9cf5ea273dc9888733091885e`. PR #1–#6 are merged; no Phase 5 PR exists.
This review branch inherits Phase 5 code; its new governance/CI files are not yet published.
No review commit, push or PR has been created; these task changes remain in the worktree.
Integration must account for that stacked dependency rather than presenting Phase 5 as already
on main. The public branch metadata reported main unprotected; no GitHub settings were changed.

Completed plans under `plans/completed/` preserve their historical approval/results/checkpoint
records. The [active Phase 5 plan](../plans/active/phase-5-statistical-forecasting.md) remains active.
PROGRESS is the canonical maintained numerical-results record; duplicated plan tables are dated
snapshots, not separate results to update. No final project model has been selected.

## Immediate next boundary

Finish external Phase 5 review, then merge/close it only within explicit authorization. After
verified closeout, prepare the Phase 6 design using the [repository handoff](PROJECT_PLAN.md#phase-6-handoff--read-before-design-or-code).
This review does not implement LightGBM, archive Phase 5, or close Phase 5.

The current forecasting firewall excludes July 4–31 from tuning/selection/calibration and has
produced no final-holdout forecasts/metrics. Earlier full-source validation and descriptive EDA
did include those labels; [EDA_FINDINGS](EDA_FINDINGS.md) records that exposure. Do not claim an
entirely never-inspected test set or reuse those full-period cohorts for modeling. ADR-015 defers
the single authorized sequential final evaluation until model, intervals and policies are frozen.

## Branch cleanup inventory

GitHub snapshot, 2026-10-05; cleanup is recommended only after checking unique commits and working
changes. No local or remote branches were deleted in this review.

| Candidate branch | Merged work | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| `feat/data-preparation-eda` | [PR #2](https://github.com/mihikari29/it4063e-rossmann-demand-forecasting/pull/2) | Retire after unique-change check |
| `feat/feature-engineering` | [PR #3](https://github.com/mihikari29/it4063e-rossmann-demand-forecasting/pull/3) | Retire after unique-change check |
| `docs/phase-3-closeout` | [PR #4](https://github.com/mihikari29/it4063e-rossmann-demand-forecasting/pull/4) | Retire after unique-change check |
| `feat/seasonal-naive` | [PR #5](https://github.com/mihikari29/it4063e-rossmann-demand-forecasting/pull/5) | Retire after unique-change check |
| `docs/phase-4-closeout` | [PR #6](https://github.com/mihikari29/it4063e-rossmann-demand-forecasting/pull/6) | Retire after unique-change check |

`feat/holt-winters` is active, not a cleanup candidate. The old
`origin/feat/data-acquisition-validation` exists only as a stale local tracking ref: that branch
is absent from GitHub's current branch list. Prune it during authorized maintenance. Main and this
review branch are retained; fresh work should not continue on merged branches.

## Source and Preparation Evidence

- Official raw CSVs remain unchanged and Git-ignored; their four SHA-256 hashes matched the
  documented source snapshot before and after preparation.
- Historical train: 1,017,209 rows, 1,115 stores, 2013-01-01 through 2015-07-31. Test: 41,088
  future-covariate rows, 856 stores, 2015-08-01 through 2015-09-17. Both metadata joins preserve
  row counts and unique Store × Date keys.
- The sparse historical output retains all source rows, including closed and open/zero-Sales days.
  No synthetic calendar rows or zero fills were added. Test remains separate and has no Sales or
  Customers.
- The 180-store 184-day gap, 54 open/zero-Sales rows, 11 missing test Open statuses, and 259
  metadata stores unused by test have documented evidence and dispositions. Store 622's original
  missing Open statuses remain null in `test.parquet`; the separate audit output contains 11
  uncertain unanimous historical-context candidates.
- Promo2 details retain structural nulls for all 544 nonparticipants. The 354 paired missing
  competition-open dates remain unexplained and unfilled; three missing CompetitionDistance
  values remain missing.
- Ignored Parquet outputs are reproducible through PyArrow 24.0.0. EDA tables, manifests, and
  figures are local generated artifacts under `reports/eda/`.

## Phase 3 Implementation and Closeout Evidence

- `python scripts/build_features.py` completed with contract `phase-3-v1`: 1,017,209 training
  rows and 41,088 inference rows, preserving input Store × Date keys and the shared ordered
  29-predictor schema. The outputs and manifest are ignored under `data/processed/`.
- Development feature-coverage diagnostics end on 2015-07-03. They record 313,436 nulls each for
  `competition_has_opened` and `competition_age_months` (the 354 jointly missing competition
  metadata stores), 2,558 missing `competition_distance` values, and expected exact-history warm-up
  and sparse-gap nulls. No imputations were introduced. Promo2 produced no invalid/incomplete
  schedule findings in the prepared snapshot; nonparticipants remain inactive despite structural
  schedule nulls.
- For a gap-affected store, all dynamic history fields are unavailable on 2015-01-01; lag 1 resumes
  on Jan 2; lag 7 and the 7-day window resume Jan 8; lag 14 and the 14-day windows resume Jan 15;
  all ten dynamic fields resume Jan 29 after the complete 28-day window exists. No absent dates
  were bridged or synthesized.
- The final holdout remains 2015-07-04 through 2015-07-31 (31,220 store-days). Its audit is
  mechanical only: predictor schema/order, unique keys, and dtype compatibility. No holdout
  distribution or forecast metric was summarized. Development coverage stops July 3.
- The feature runner verified all four raw-source hashes and the three prepared Parquet hashes
  against the approved source snapshot and Phase 2 manifest before and after the build. The raw
  validator also passed without errors. Store 622 Open candidates remain audit fields; inference
  contains no Sales, Customers, or Customers-derived fields.
- Future-known/static inference predictors are materialized for all test rows. Without recursive
  predictions, dynamic values needing exact dates after the forecast origin remain null; later
  recursive steps can supply predictions through the origin-censored history API.
- Repeated deterministic builds produced the same SHA-256 for each corresponding artifact:
  `features_train.parquet` matched its prior build, and `features_inference.parquet` matched its
  prior build. These two distinct artifacts do not share a hash. No holdout distributions were
  summarized.
- Detailed field semantics, roles, dtypes, null behavior, and point-in-time rules are in
  [Feature Contract](FEATURE_CONTRACT.md); the completed execution plan is archived at
  `plans/completed/phase-3-feature-engineering.md`.
- External review follow-up canonicalizes history keys before duplicate/overlap checks, grouping,
  or exact-date lookup: Store IDs are validated positive exact integers representable as int64;
  Dates are parsed as midnight calendar values and stored as datetime64[ns]. The shared key path
  copies inputs and is also used by static predictor assembly. Focused regression coverage now
  includes fractional/out-of-range IDs, canonical Store/Date collisions, valid coercion, and input
  non-mutation.

## Phase 3 Quality Checkpoint (Historical)

- `python scripts/validate_data.py --report reports/validation/rossmann.json`: PASS — 0 errors,
  4 reviewed warnings, 12 informational findings.
- `python scripts/build_features.py`: PASS — raw/interim provenance checks, key preservation,
  matching predictor schemas/dtypes, holdout mechanical audit, and output generation.
- Full suite chronology: 45 passed before the external-review key-canonicalization fix; 56 passed
  after the fix and again at PR readiness, including the key-canonicalization regression cases.
- `ruff check .`: passed; `ruff format --check .`: 45 files already formatted.
- `git diff --check`: passed. Relative Markdown links in changed user-facing documentation: passed.
- Preparation and EDA commands completed against the official data; both notebooks validated and
  executed successfully with cleared committed outputs.

## Phase 4 Scope Confirmation at Closeout

At the Phase 4 closeout checkpoint, only the explicitly approved Seasonal Naive baseline was
implemented; Holt-Winters and later-phase work had not begun. Sales remains monetary turnover at
Store × Date; future Customers remain unavailable to forecasts. Primary evaluation uses actual
source Open=1 observations, while the known-closed zero rule is applied only to the separate
operational forecast after raw generation.

## Phase 4 Implementation and Development Results

- The approved methodology is recorded in accepted ADR-013, which remains unchanged. External
  review found no blocking issue; PR #5 received final approval and merged into `main` at
  `12f80b5fe8a8580b3d8367cd473766decd3ebf31`. The completed execution plan is archived at
  [`plans/completed/phase-4-seasonal-naive.md`](../plans/completed/phase-4-seasonal-naive.md).
- `python scripts/run_seasonal_naive.py` completed successfully against the existing prepared
  Rossmann historical table. The runner read only `Store`, `Date`, `Sales`, and source `Open`, and
  applied the Parquet Date filter through 2015-07-03 before evaluation. It ran exactly the three
  approved development windows and emitted 46,830 observed target records. Generated outputs are
  ignored under `data/processed/seasonal_naive/`; the manifest records the methodology, windows,
  source hashes, and artifact hashes.
- Coverage and primary metrics by window (coverage is available raw forecasts / denominator):

  | Window | Observed targets | Eligible open labels | All-target coverage | Open-label coverage | MAE | RMSE | MAPE | MAPE rows / eligible | Zero rows excluded from MAPE | WAPE |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
  | validation_1 | 15,610 | 11,678 | 15,610 / 15,610 (100%) | 11,678 / 11,678 (100%) | 1,101.5940 | 1,444.9870 | 15.0088% | 11,678 / 11,678 (100%) | 0 | 0.143224 |
  | validation_2 | 15,610 | 13,438 | 15,610 / 15,610 (100%) | 13,438 / 13,438 (100%) | 2,269.7721 | 3,141.3506 | 36.1046% | 13,438 / 13,438 (100%) | 0 | 0.324782 |
  | validation_3 | 15,610 | 13,437 | 15,610 / 15,610 (100%) | 13,437 / 13,437 (100%) | 1,596.5170 | 2,253.3165 | 26.2135% | 13,437 / 13,437 (100%) | 0 | 0.226393 |

- Pooled eligible development rows: 38,553. Pooled MAE **1,681.2703**, RMSE **2,416.9677**,
  MAPE **26.2671%** (38,553 MAPE rows, 0 zero-actual rows excluded, 100% MAPE coverage), and
  WAPE **0.232748**. These are computed over pooled eligible observations, not averaged window
  metrics.
- Horizon-level eligible counts and metrics (WAPE is a ratio; MAPE is a percent):

  | Horizon | Eligible | MAE | RMSE | MAPE | WAPE |
  |---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
  | 1 | 3,344 | 672.2425 | 981.3211 | 11.9931% | 0.114442 |
  | 2 | 97 | 861.8763 | 1,187.4567 | 14.7578% | 0.108050 |
  | 3 | 2,262 | 4,259.5504 | 4,747.9555 | 72.8666% | 0.677632 |
  | 4 | 3,344 | 2,307.4554 | 2,739.8971 | 39.9556% | 0.368580 |
  | 5 | 3,344 | 2,131.9731 | 2,459.9699 | 38.2207% | 0.362656 |
  | 6 | 3,344 | 2,405.0329 | 3,161.1523 | 42.6760% | 0.407425 |
  | 7 | 3,344 | 1,765.8403 | 2,232.6592 | 30.0997% | 0.273202 |
  | 8 | 3,344 | 832.9013 | 1,125.0257 | 14.0842% | 0.135236 |
  | 9 | 96 | 752.7188 | 1,039.2468 | 10.4863% | 0.089113 |
  | 10 | 3,344 | 1,025.8322 | 1,418.5733 | 9.7639% | 0.097370 |
  | 11 | 3,344 | 1,141.4202 | 1,587.1030 | 11.6617% | 0.122944 |
  | 12 | 3,343 | 1,124.9399 | 1,441.6304 | 13.9331% | 0.137552 |
  | 13 | 2,660 | 2,460.7320 | 3,971.0272 | 33.6384% | 0.324489 |
  | 14 | 3,343 | 1,091.0808 | 1,453.2243 | 13.6778% | 0.136541 |

- All 46,830 observed target records had an available raw forecast (46,830 / 46,830); therefore
  there were no unavailable weekly baseline forecasts, no affected Store × Date rows, and no
  unavailable-store cases to report. Open-labelled forecast coverage was also 100% in each window.
- No final-holdout forecast, score, metric, or target summary was produced. Phase 4 reads are
  restricted to dates through 2015-07-03 before the evaluation layer; only development outputs
  appear in the generated artifact directory.
- Raw Rossmann inputs and Phase 2 `train.parquet` hashes matched their recorded provenance before
  and after the run. The runner wrote only Git-ignored generated files; no raw, interim, or Phase 3
  files were modified, and generated results remain ignored and untracked. `docs/proposal.md` is
  unchanged.
- Validation at Phase 4 completion: full pytest suite **73 passed**; `ruff check .`,
  `ruff format --check .`, and `git diff --check` passed. The Seasonal Naive CLI completed
  successfully with unchanged input provenance. Phase 4 is formally COMPLETE. At the Phase 4
  closeout checkpoint, Phase 5 implementation had not begun; no final-holdout result was produced.

## Phase 5 Statistical Forecasting Approval and Implementation

- Status at approval checkpoint: **APPROVED / IMPLEMENTATION IN PROGRESS**. The user explicitly
  approved the fixed Holt-Winters methodology and its 99% coverage guardrail on 2026-10-05. Phase 5
  implementation and real-data results are recorded below as they are produced.
- The design plan is [`plans/active/phase-5-statistical-forecasting.md`](../plans/active/phase-5-statistical-forecasting.md).
- A mechanical history-availability audit projected only `Store` and `Date` from the existing
  training feature Parquet and filtered dates to `<= 2015-07-03`. It used no Sales, Open,
  Customers, forecast, metric, or holdout field/value. All 1,115 target Stores in each approved
  development window had at least 28 consecutive observed dates ending at the origin:

  | Window | Target Stores | Origin-row Stores | ≥28 days | 14–27 days | 7–13 days | 2–6 days | 0–1 day | Eligible |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
  | validation_1 | 1,115 | 1,115 | 1,115 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1,115 / 1,115 (100.00%) |
  | validation_2 | 1,115 | 1,115 | 1,115 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1,115 / 1,115 (100.00%) |
  | validation_3 | 1,115 | 1,115 | 1,115 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1,115 / 1,115 (100.00%) |

- At the approval checkpoint, this date-only result suggested no date-availability coverage loss
  under the minimum-history rule. It did not establish Sales validity or model-fit success;
  numerical failures were then unmeasured. The implementation evidence below records the later
  successful fits. The approved policy has no fallback.
- The audit stopped at 2015-07-03 and did not read holdout Sales. It produced no holdout forecast
  or evaluation; the earlier descriptive exposure is disclosed above.

### Phase 5 Implementation and Development Results

- The approved design is implemented on `feat/holt-winters` under accepted ADR-014. The package
  provides origin-censored, per-Store additive Holt-Winters fitting, latest-contiguous-history
  eligibility, a single internal 14-step forecast operation, clipped raw forecasts with retained
  unclipped values, explicit unavailable reasons, and post-forecast Open routing. There is no
  fallback model. The dependency resolved to statsmodels 0.15.0.
- `python scripts/run_holt_winters.py` completed successfully against the existing Phase 2
  `train.parquet`. Its Parquet projection includes only Store, Date, Sales, and Open, and the Date
  predicate is applied at read time through 2015-07-03. It evaluated the three approved development
  windows and recomputed Seasonal Naive from the reviewed Phase 4 implementation. Raw Rossmann and
  Phase 2 hashes matched before and after the run. No final-holdout forecast, score, or metric was
  produced.
- The run generated 46,830 observed target forecasts and 46,830 internal 14-step path records
  across 3,345 Store-origin fits. All 3,345 fits succeeded; there were no unavailable forecasts,
  fit/forecast failures, warnings, or optimizer non-convergence flags. All three windows achieved
  100% raw and Open-label forecast coverage, above the precommitted 99% coverage guardrail.
- Standalone Holt-Winters metrics (primary population: observed source Open=1 and Sales, with
  available clipped raw forecast):

  | Window | Observed targets | Eligible open labels | Open-label coverage | MAE | RMSE | MAPE | WAPE |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
  | validation_1 | 15,610 | 11,678 | 11,678 / 11,678 (100%) | 1,195.5661 | 1,617.4146 | 15.2155% | 0.155442 |
  | validation_2 | 15,610 | 13,438 | 13,438 / 13,438 (100%) | 1,136.8306 | 1,483.1660 | 16.9474% | 0.162669 |
  | validation_3 | 15,610 | 13,437 | 13,437 / 13,437 (100%) | 1,501.5664 | 1,974.7435 | 22.5253% | 0.212929 |

- Pooled over 38,553 eligible rows, Holt-Winters MAE was **1,281.7446**, RMSE **1,708.3073**,
  MAPE **18.3669%**, and WAPE **0.177439**. MAPE included 38,553 positive-actual rows, excluded
  zero rows: 0, and had 100% MAPE coverage. Pooled values are calculated over rows, not averaged
  from window metrics.
- Paired comparison uses the identical 38,553 eligible Store-origin-Date rows where both
  recomputed Seasonal Naive and Holt-Winters forecasts were available. A negative MAE difference
  means Holt-Winters MAE is lower; this fixed-candidate development comparison is not final model
  selection:

  | Window | Paired rows | Holt-Winters MAE | Seasonal Naive MAE | Difference (HW - SN) | Relative change | Lower paired MAE |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
  | validation_1 | 11,678 | 1,195.5661 | 1,101.5940 | +93.9721 | +8.5306% | Seasonal Naive |
  | validation_2 | 13,438 | 1,136.8306 | 2,269.7721 | -1,132.9415 | -49.9143% | Holt-Winters |
  | validation_3 | 13,437 | 1,501.5664 | 1,596.5170 | -94.9506 | -5.9474% | Holt-Winters |
  | pooled | 38,553 | 1,281.7446 | 1,681.2703 | -399.5257 | -23.7633% | Holt-Winters |

- Additive forecasts below zero were clipped only for the raw metric forecast; unclipped values
  remain in the audit output. In the full internal paths, 1,085 of 46,830 forecasts (2.3169%)
  were clipped. The minimum unclipped forecast was -4,175.2857. By window, clipping was
  354 / 15,610 (2.2678%), 408 / 15,610 (2.6137%), and 323 / 15,610 (2.0692%), respectively.
- Ignored artifacts and a manifest are under `data/processed/holt_winters/`: observed-key
  forecasts, internal 14-step paths, per-fit and aggregated diagnostics, window/pooled/horizon
  metrics, coverage guardrail, identical-row paired forecasts and metrics, and clipping
  diagnostics. All emitted dates are 2015-05-23 through 2015-07-03; all 46,830 composite keys are
  unique. The generated forecast table does not expose the protected holdout.
- Initial executions exposed two post-fit reporting defects (strict JSON serialization of a
  missing pooled label, and a clipping-rate denominator reference); both were corrected and covered
  by tests. The final real-data runner completed with exit code 0 and regenerated all artifacts.
- Initial Phase 5 implementation checks: full pytest suite **95 passed**;
  `ruff check src tests scripts` and `ruff format --check src tests scripts` passed. Artifact paths
  were verified Git-ignored;
  provenance checks passed before and after evaluation. Phase 5 remains **IMPLEMENTED / UNDER
  REVIEW**, not formally closed. `docs/proposal.md`, reviewed Phase 4 model code/artifacts, raw data,
  and Phase 2 prepared data were not modified.
- External review found that the reusable Holt-Winters API validated horizons from 1–14 but still
  generated a fixed 14-step path. The forecaster now consistently uses the validated
  horizon for model forecasts, output-length validation, and internal path rows, records
  `forecast_horizon` for successful and failed fits, and computes clipping rates over successful
  requested forecast steps. Regression tests cover 7- and 14-step behavior, target bounds, output
  lengths, failed-fit paths, and horizon-aware clipping rates. The approved Phase 5 runner continues
  to request 14 days. Its post-fix rerun reproduced the recorded metrics unchanged: 46,830 forecasts,
  3,345 successful Store-origin fits, 100% availability in every window, and a passed 99% coverage
  guardrail. The ignored fit-diagnostics artifact now includes `forecast_horizon`; artifact hashes
  were regenerated for the updated output schema. Full-repository validation passed: pytest **102
  passed**, `ruff check .`, `ruff format --check .`, `git diff --check`, and relative Markdown-link
  validation across 19 files. No holdout forecast or evaluation occurred; Phase 5 remains
  **IMPLEMENTED / UNDER REVIEW**.

## Repository Architecture/Governance Review — 2026-10-05

The [completed review task plan](../plans/completed/repository-architecture-governance-review.md)
records scope and cross-review. Verdict: **READY for the next authorized design task**, not an
authorization to implement Phase 6 or a declaration that Phase 5 is closed.

- Reviewed all listed governance/data docs, active/completed plans, source/script/test/notebook
  structure, and public branch/merged-PR metadata. Current-state, branch, phase, artifact-path,
  terminology and local Markdown references were cross-checked; archived evidence was preserved.
- ADR-015–018 trace the fixes: final evaluation after all choices freeze, disclosed descriptive
  exposure, consistent simulated inventory values/cumulative uncertainty, simpler application and
  work-package boundaries, portable locked environments and fixture CI. AGENTS/WORKFLOW now own
  approval/lifecycle rules; this document owns maintained results, not duplicated plan tables.
- The Phase 6 handoff specifies origin-censored fitting/history, future-known covariates,
  categorical/null adapter design, raw recursion versus Open routing, metric/coverage interfaces,
  outputs, tests and approval. No LightGBM or later-phase module/dependency was implemented.
- Forecast algorithms/configurations and existing numerical evidence were unchanged. Three
  exception clauses gained tuple parentheses for Python 3.12 compatibility. Source hash-only
  verification matched all four documented raw hashes; no data/model pipeline or holdout
  forecasting/evaluation was run for this review.

The continuation recovered the existing dirty review branch at HEAD `3d4fbfd`: 18 modified and
five new files, nothing staged. Full-file rereads, diff/history inspection and a fresh repository-
only Phase 6 handoff audit preserved that work. Two residual ambiguities were corrected: LightGBM
feeds predictions, never unrevealed target actuals; final scheduled preprocessing/model refits may
update fitted state only under the frozen recipe using already revealed training rows. No new
phase scope or methodology search was introduced. The quality gate was rerun after these fixes.

Final checks actually executed:

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `python -m pytest` in the original Python 3.14.5 environment | 106 passed; includes four new Markdown-checker fixtures |
| Complete fixture suite in isolated locked Python 3.12.15 / 3.14.5 | 106 passed in each environment |
| `python -m ruff check .` | PASS |
| `python -m ruff format --check .` | PASS; 63 files already formatted |
| `python scripts/check_docs.py` | PASS; local files/directories/common heading anchors across 20 Markdown files |
| `git diff --check` | PASS |
| `uv lock --check` / `uv pip check` | PASS; current lock and compatible installed packages |
| Numbering and math checks | Phase 0–14, proposal 1–30, ADR-001–018 and paired proposal dollar delimiters PASS |

Remaining non-blocking limits: only 42 development target days and prior descriptive holdout
exposure; pooled empirical intervals/simulated policies require their later reviewed designs.
GitHub Actions has not run remotely, main protection is not enabled, and stale branch cleanup
needs separate authorization/unique-change checks. Phase 5 external review/integration/closeout
remains the immediate project gate. All new review changes are local and uncommitted.
